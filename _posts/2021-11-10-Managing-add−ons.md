# Managing add-ons in Google Docs

   Since add-ons are made by third-party content creators, Google cannot guarantee that all of them are safe, secure, or reliable.
It's a good idea to read some of the reviews to see whether other users have had a good experience with the add-on.
As part of the installation process, you have to receive the add-on certain permissions for the ability to view and manage all of the files in your Google Drive.
If you're not comfortable granting these permissions, you should not install the add-on. 

## How to install an add-on?

To install an add-on:
1. Select **Add-ons** in the toolbar.
