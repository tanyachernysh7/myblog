# Managing access to the documents in Google Docs

    The ability to share documents and work collaboratively is one of the most useful things about Google Drive. 
Here are some tips on how to get started.

## How to share a single item with specific people?

 To share a single item with specific people:

1. Open a file in Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides.

2. Click **Share**.

3. Type the email address of the person or Google Group you want to share with. 

   **Note**! 

 To choose if a person can view, comment, or edit the file, click the **Down arrow** next to the text box. 
 
 

4. Click **Done**. 


   **Note**! 

The people you shared with will get an email letting them know you've shared a file.



## How to share a single item using a link?

   **Note**!

Use this method when you don’t know everyone’s email address, aren’t sure if they all have a Google account, or simply want a document to be more widely available.



To share a single item using a link:

1. Open a file in Google Docs, Sheets, or Slides.

2. Click **Share**.

3. Click "**Get shareable link**" in the top right of the "**Share with others**" box.

To choose whether a person can view, comment, or edit the file, click the **Down arrow** next to "**Anyone with the link**."

A file link will be copied to your clipboard.
Paste the link in an email or anywhere you want to share it.

## How to share a folder?

 The following steps are useful if you plan to collaborate with a group of people on a recurring basis. It is more convenient to create a shared folder or a shared drive. The files placed in this folder are automatically shared with the group.  

To create a folder:

1. Click **New**>**Folder**.

2. Enter a name for the folder.

3. Click **Create**.

To share the folder:

1. Select the name of the folder in Google Drive. 
2. Click **Share**.

   **Tip**!
 
 You can also right-click the folder and choose **Share**.
 
 

Under "**People**" in the "**Share with others**" box, type the email address of the person or Google Group with whom you want to share.

   **Tip**!

Search for contacts by typing a name in the box.
Make sure their access level is set to "**Can Edit**".



## How to share drives?

 Shared drives are shared spaces where teams can easily store, search, and access their files anywhere, from any device. Unlike files in **My Drive**, files in a shared drive belong to the team instead of an individual. Even if members leave, the files stay exactly where they are so your team can continue to share information and get work done.

To share drives:

1. Change ownership of a file or folder. You can assign someone else to be the "owner" of a file or folder. The owner has complete control over access, visibility, and can choose to delete the file.  

### How to change owners?

To change who owns a file or folder in Drive:

1. Go to Drive or a Docs, Sheets, or Slides home screen.
2. Open the sharing box.
3. In Drive select the **File** or **Folder**.
4. Click the **Share** icon.
   In a Docs, Sheets, or Slides home screen open the **File**>click **Share**.
